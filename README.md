# ToDoApp
This is a final project I produced for an android development course. This To-Do List app creates a list of groups of elements that each make up a task,
with and optional comments section to write specifics about that task. A nice chunk of making it was getting it to save in case of rotation or app close which I really wanted to
make work. That part uses the shared preferences function to save each task and comment albiet not always. I believe it doesn't save all the time on my phone because my phone 
closes apps different. Shared preferences might not have been the best way to make it save but I decided to use that over a firebase or other database. This isn't that glamorous
but I do like this project and was aiming to make something I'd actually use daily, one day I will probably give it a database so I can do that.
